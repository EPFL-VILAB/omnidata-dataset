This repository contains the Starter Dataset generated by the Omnidata Annotator from our paper:

**Omnidata: A Scalable Pipeline for Making Multi-Task Mid-Level Vision Datasets from 3D Scans** (ICCV2021)

## Introduction:
We provide a Starter Dataset generated by Omnidata Pipeline from some existing 3D datasets. It contains more than `14 million` images from over `2000 spaces` with `21 different mid-level vision cues` per image. The dataset covers very diverse scenes (indoors and outdoors) and views (scene- and object-centric).

## Downloading the Full Dataset:
The full starter dataset will be available to download soon.

## Sample Data:
[Here](https://github.com/Ainaz99/omnidata-sample-data), we provide a sample data from a random building in our **GSO + Replica** dataset split, which is created by scattering [Google Scanned Objects](https://app.ignitionrobotics.org/GoogleResearch/fuel/collections/Google%20Scanned%20Objects) around [Replica](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Replica-Dataset) buildings using the [Habitat](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim) environment. This is only a sample scene (with mostly object-centric views) from over `2000 scenes` available in the full dataset.
